  <!-- Main Content -->
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <p>As i begin this, i am 27 years old working and have been working in Software support for a couple of years. Before that i worked in the hospitality industry for around 7 years, this allowed me to overcome the social anxiety barrier i had.</p>
        <p>Having a BSc in Computer science many years ago, i had no idea what i wanted to do and whilst watching one of the new shows on Amazon Prime, <i>"Mr. Robot."</i> I was flabbergasted. 
An absolute thriller about a group of hackitivists battling it out against a giant conglomerate. It really showcased how easy people could be exploited through different means to get sensitive information.
</p>
        <p>I knew about the basics of network security but the show was really an eye opener. 

This was when i decided i wanted to learn more and after several days of hardcore Googling i was very lost, there was alot of content and not really much guidance as to where to begin. At the same time an advert for a Network Security and Pen Testing course appeared at a University.
</p>
          <p>I took on this course and whilst I felt alot of it was theory work, it did give me an insight as to what is available and the routes i can take. 
As mentioned, the theory work we had to learn was tedious and very long. There was really not much Lab work to offer and the basics of Linux really didn't wet my whistle. I overcame this boredom by creating a hardcore gaming addiction . It was a problem and i knew that it was bringing up a barrier around me again, i felt like the way to deal with this was to play more games. I felt like i was digging myself a deeper hole but the only way to solve this was to keep digging.</p>
          <p>After many years, realising it is <i>now or never</i>, i am ready to stop. I have done some extensive research and decided where to start. I feel that I know a little bit of everything but not enough enough to say that I am competent in any matter. </p>
              <p>I know that even after my hours of again Googling <i>"How to get into Infosec"</i>  I will probably regret many steps of the way. But as i document my progress i will be able to look back and learn.</p>
          
          <p> <i> P.S. Once again, I profusely apologise in advance if there are any grammar and punctuation mistakes. Also please do not look at the page source as i have made an absolute mess of my website. Instead of look for a blogging site to write on, I have decided to try and create my own using a template in Github. </i></p>
