        <p>As i begin this, i am 27 years old working and have been working in Software support for a couple of years. Before that i worked in the hospitality industry for around 7 years, this allowed me to overcome the social anxiety barrier i had.</p>
        <p>Having a BSc in Computer science many years ago, i had no idea what i wanted to do and whilst watching one of the new shows on Amazon Prime, <i>"Mr. Robot."</i> I was flabbergasted. 
An absolute thriller that displayed everyday exploits of the world, therefore showing us how vulnerable we can be in reality.
</p>
        <p>I knew about the basics of network security but the show was really an eye opener. 

This was when i decided i wanted to learn more and after several days of hardcore Googling i was very lost, there was alot of content and not really much guidance as to where to begin. At the same time an advert for a Network Security and Pen Testing course appeared at a University.
</p>
          <p>I took on this course and whilst the 90% of it was theory work, it did give me an insight as to what is available and the routes i can take. 
As mentioned, the theory work we had to learn was tedious and very long. There was really not much Lab work to offer and the basics of Linux really didn't wet my whistle. I overcame this boredom by creating a hardcore gaming addiction . It was a problem and i knew that it was bringing up a barrier around me again, i felt like the way to deal with this was to play more games. I felt like i was digging myself a deeper hole but the only way to solve this was to keep digging.</p>
          <p>After many years, realising it is <i>now or never</i>, i am ready to stop. I have done some extensive research and decided where to start.

I know that even after my hours of again Googling <i>"How to get into Infosec"</i>  I will probably regret many steps of the way. But as i document my progress i will be able to look back and learn.</p>
