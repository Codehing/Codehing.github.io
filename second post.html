        <p>When you get the motivation to try and achieve something, you experience the absolute fire for a good few hours, or days. I find all the content I want and feel as if the ride will be this smooth all the way. Knowing where to begin and predicting how many months it will take me.
          <br> Even though, inside I know that <b> 100%</b> I am completely wrong.  </p>
    <p>The best thing about the Internet is that there is so much awesome content out there like - </p>  
          
          <dl>
         <dt> YouTube</dt>
              <dt> Udemy</dt><dt> RootMe</dt><dt> HackTheBox - HTB</dt><dt> TryHackMe - THM</dt>          </dl>
          
          <p> I have spent so many hours googling I could make the worlds biggest list of content but the hardest part is sticking to a few things so that you do not get side tracked.  </p>
          
          <p> I follow various sources like CyberWire, CSO Online & Hackernoon. Then I get motivation from the Cyber Security Subreddit and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/">netsecstudents</a>. </p>
          
          <p> The decision was made to begin with <a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a> </p>
          <p> Honestly, I could not find a better place to refresh my memory on the fundamentals and learn some new things as well. The best thing about this starting content is that, it is completely free. Back in the days of learning the OSI model and a nice Netowrking introduction.<br>Once thing that caught my eye was the three-way handshake, this can be remembered by Frank SYN-ACKtra! Get it? Hehehe.<br> <i>(Credit to Kieran Smith, Abertay University)</i> 
          <br> In TryHackMe, the best thing was </p>
          <p> In the earlier times when I first opened up Command Prompt and pinged Google, it returned an IP address. <i> Omg, just hacked Google?</i> </p>
          <p> So whilst procrascinating, I attempted HackTheBox on the side and boy was I addicted. This is my problem, I really do get side tracked. <br> With HackTheBox I am learning much more by really researching and avoiding the guides whilst with TryHackMe it felt like I was in class again. I think by spending equal time on both sites I feel more motivated as if i stay on one matter to long I may end up going off track.
